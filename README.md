# Executive Order (EO) Project

This project analyzes and predicts the issuance of U.S. Presidential Executive Orders (EOs) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training a neural network to forecast EO counts.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Collection

- **Source:** [Federal Register API](https://www.federalregister.gov/)
- **Downloader:** `eo_grabber` function in `utils.py`
- **Data:** Executive order metadata since 2000 (document number, EO number, president, dates, title, etc.)

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Convert date columns to datetime.
- Handle missing values (e.g., impute signing dates).
- Engineer features:
  - President's term and party
  - EO title length
  - Days since term start
  - Monthly and yearly aggregations
  - Previous year/month EO counts

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Inspect data types, missing values, and duplicates.
- Explore EO issuance patterns by president, party, and term.

### 4. Feature Engineering

- One-hot encode categorical variables (term, party).
- Create time-based features (month, year, EO counts per month, etc.).
- Standardize features using `RobustScaler`.

### 5. Modeling

- **Model:** Feedforward neural network (PyTorch)
- **Inputs:** Engineered and standardized features
- **Target:** Monthly EO count (log-transformed)
- **Training:** Mini-batch SGD, MSE loss, 10,000 epochs
- **Evaluation:** MSE and RMSE on test set, predictions inverse-transformed for interpretability

### 6. Results

- Model performance is evaluated and compared to actual EO counts.
- Results are displayed in tabular form and can be visualized.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pytorch-lightning
- pytorch-forecasting

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib pytorch-lightning pytorch-forecasting
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to `EO_Project`.
2. **Run `eo_notebook.ipynb`** in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. The notebook will:
   - Download and preprocess EO data
   - Engineer features
   - Train and evaluate a neural network model
   - Output predictions and evaluation metrics

## Notes

- The project is modular: utility functions are in `utils.py`.
- The model and feature pipeline can be easily extended for other time series or policy analysis tasks.
- Data is refreshed each run via the Federal Register API.
